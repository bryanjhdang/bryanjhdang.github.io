# Portfolio
Personal portfolio to show off my projects and stuff.

## Run locally
- Clone the project
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

## To update the website with local changes
- Continue making changes normally
- `npm run deploy` to build the dist folder onto `gh-pages` branch
- Remember to commit and push changes to main after too
